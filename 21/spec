swap position X with position Y
/swap position ([\d]+) with position Y/

means that the letters at indexes X and Y (counting from 0) should be swapped.


swap letter X with letter Y
/swap letter ([\w]) with letter ([\w])/

means that the letters X and Y should be swapped (regardless of where they appear in the string).


rotate left/right X steps
/rotate left/right ([\d]+) steps/

means that the whole string should be rotated; for example, one right rotation would turn abcd into dabc.


rotate based on position of letter X
/rotate based on position of letter ([\w])/

means that the whole string should be rotated to the right based on the index of letter X (counting from 0) as determined before this instruction does any rotations. Once the index is determined, rotate the string to the right one time, plus a number of times equal to that index, plus one additional time if the index was at least 4.


reverse positions X through Y
/reverse positions ([\d]+) through ([\d]+)/

means that the span of letters at indexes X through Y (including the letters at X and Y) should be reversed in order.


move position X to position Y
/move position ([\d]+) to position ([\d]+)/

means that the letter which is at index X should be removed from the string, then inserted such that it ends up at index Y.
